Communication isn't just about talking; it's about conveying information effectively and ensuring it's understood. The **three core elements** that make up any communication process are:

*   **Message:** The information being conveyed. A well-structured and clear message is crucial to avoid misinterpretation.
*   **Receiver:** The individual or group receiving the message. Their background, experiences, and perception filter the message.

Understanding these components is the first step toward becoming a more effective communicator.
